# Things I've learned about jobs (searching, career strategy, etc)

No prose, just small, discrete tips/bits of info. Many are things I'd wish I knew or did in hindsight.

## General

* Always negotiate
* Always try to get more than one offer
* Follow all of [patio11's advice](https://www.kalzumeus.com/)
* LinkedIn sometimes actually works

## Academia

### Postdocs

* Network as a grad student -- give at least one talk/poster in a non-local venue a year
* Ask to write grants with your and other PIs, the more collaborators the better
* To better your chances for getting a good postdoc, have your advisor write to your prospective postdoc advisor, many PIs I know say "I'm not taking postdocs *unless their advisor calls me first*.
* If you're shooting for faculty jobs after, consider the track record of your prospective advisor for helping postdocs land faculty jobs
* In some universities/departments (but not all), it is a plus to do grad school in one place/country but postdoc in another, check your faculty
* Try arriving at your postdoc with a postdoc grant/fellowship in place, you can start applying the last year of your PhD.
* Try getting super postdocs if possible -- semi-independent positions with good funding  (Harvard fellows, Miller felllowship, Whitehead, Marie-Curie).

### Faculty jobs

Though I never applied to faculty jobs, these are some things I've typically heard from friends and family that have gone that route

* Know your hiring committee -- check your network to see who has hiring decision influence wherever you're applying
* Don't underestimate the power of local networks -- if you want a job in your home country but have been out of it for grad school/postdoc, retain connections back home to avoid being the outsider
* Start path to independence early -- know what the grant path is for your field/country (for bio in US it's typically applying to a K99 grant)
* Write grants *excatly* as you are expected to, check resources like [Russ Altman's tips for grant writing](http://bytesizebio.net/2012/07/19/ismb-2012-vignettes-pt-1-grant-writing-tips/)
* Preprints are your friend
* Know your competition : "70% have a first-author paper in Cell, Nature, or Science, 22% have a K99, and 30% have unpublished work on bioRxiv."  --> from [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JSheltzer/status/1293234892063506433)

## Industry

### Startups

* Startups can be very small (as in just two people) or have hundreds of employees. Treat the latter as a big corp rather than a startup.
* Startups are driven by funding cycles, especially if they take venture capital moeny -- in this case path is Seed money -> Series A/B/C/D... Each "Series" funding is typically bigger than the last Series and is one marker of how valuable the company is perceived
* Use crunchbase to learn about a potential startup to join and check trajectories for similar startups
* Venture capital firms fund lots of startups and there is a lot of interplay/ideas/mental motifs shared between the companies of each venture capital firm. Soemtimes it's useful to see a set of startups tied to a small set of venture capital firms as a conglomerate of connected companies instead of individual entities.
* Lots of venture capitalists are in twitter and they like to tweet a lot about what they are excited about, it's a potential good source for job searching


### Big corps

* Know the dress code, especially for interviews.
