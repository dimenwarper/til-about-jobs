# Things I've learned about jobs (searching, career strategy, etc)

Small, discrete tips/bits of info. Many are things I'd wish I knew or did in hindsight.

## General

* Always negotiate (yes, even in academia)
* Always try to get more than one offer
* Follow all of [patio11's advice](https://www.kalzumeus.com/)
* LinkedIn sometimes actually works
* Sending CVs and cover letters to some random email/web form never works
* Join the social network that your professional society/group of people in same field uses and network there
* Not quite job advice, but be financially literate and plan your career accordingly

## Academia

### Postdocs

* Network as a grad student -- give at least one talk/poster in a non-local venue a year
* Ask to write grants with your and other PIs, the more collaborators the better
* To better your chances for getting a good postdoc, have your advisor write to your prospective postdoc advisor, many PIs I know say "I'm not taking postdocs *unless their advisor calls me first*".
* If you're shooting for faculty jobs after, consider the track record of your prospective advisor for helping postdocs land faculty jobs
* In some universities/departments (but not all), it is a plus to do grad school in one place/country but postdoc in another, check the dept's faculty
* Try arriving at your postdoc with a postdoc grant/fellowship in place, you can start applying the last year of your PhD.
* Try getting super postdocs if possible -- semi-independent positions with good funding  (Harvard fellows, Miller felllowship, Whitehead, Marie-Curie).

### Faculty jobs

Though I've never applied to faculty jobs, these are some things I've typically heard from friends and family that have gone that route

* Know your hiring committee -- check your network to see who has hiring decision influence wherever you're applying
* Don't underestimate the power of local networks -- if you want a job in your home country but have been out of it for grad school/postdoc, retain connections back home to avoid being the outsider
* Start path to independence early -- know what the grant path is for your field/country (for bio in US it's typically applying to a K99 grant)
* Write grants *exactly* as you are expected to, check resources like [Russ Altman's tips for grant writing](http://bytesizebio.net/2012/07/19/ismb-2012-vignettes-pt-1-grant-writing-tips/)
* Preprints are your friend
* Know your competition : "70% have a first-author paper in Cell, Nature, or Science, 22% have a K99, and 30% have unpublished work on bioRxiv."  --> from [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JSheltzer/status/1293234892063506433)

## Industry

### Startups

* Startups can be very small (as in just two people) or have hundreds of employees. Treat the latter as a big corp rather than a startup (see below).
* Startups are driven by funding cycles, especially if they take venture capital money -- path is tpyically Seed money then Series A/B/C/D... Each "Series" funding is typically bigger than the last Series and is one marker of the perceived value of the company.
* Use crunchbase to learn about a potential startup to join and check trajectories for similar startups
* Venture capital firms fund lots of startups and there is a lot of interplay/ideas/mental motifs shared between the portfolio of companies backed by a venture capital firm. Soemtimes it's useful to see a set of startups tied to a small set of venture capital firms as a conglomerate of connected companies instead of individual entities, especially for job hunting.
* Lots of venture capitalists are in twitter and they like to tweet a lot about what they are excited about, it's a potential good source for job searching
* Get to know what stock options are and [how they work](https://carta.com/blog/value-equity-offer-startup-equity-calculator/) to value jobs at startups accordingly.
* Especially pay attention to how equity is taxed and value options accordingly, your stock options today might be too costly tomorrow to exercise because of taxes
* Don't expect your equity to be worth anything: 30% chance you get something in return, 1% you get more than you think
* Balance the risk with passion: you really need to believe in a startup's goals to make it worth it.
* Startup job titles both matter and don't. They likely don't matter internally because you'll be doing lots of jobs (e.g. whatever needs to be done), especially at an early stage. They matter externally because there is a signal in "Senior/Principal Scientist/Engineer" vs just "Scientist/Engineer" for the outside world.

### Big corps

* Don't cold email a resume, ping a friend who works there. If you don't have any, look for a recruiter for the company in LinkedIn and email/message them to ask for openings.
* Teams within big companies can be as different as two separate companies, so keep an open mind for team switching and ask to meet multiple teams if possible.
* Advancing levels within a big company can be marred in red tape, slow, and political. If possible, try shooting for one level above what you think you'll get to avoid at least one advancement dance.
* Know the dress code, especially for interviews...especially for banks and such.
